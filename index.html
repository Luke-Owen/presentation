              <p>Peter McIndoe, a University of Arkansas student, attends the Women's March in Memphis, Tennessee. Seeing counter-protestors, he grabs a poster and writes "BIRDS AREN'T REAL" on a whim. His friend Ally Perkins films him yelling about government drone birds on the street. The video goes viral. A movement is born.</p>

              <p>McIndoe drops out of college, moves to Memphis, and commits fully to the character. He travels the country in a "conspiracy van," giving impassioned speeches about bird drones. Local chapters form organically across the US. Graffiti, chalkboard messages, and stadium chants spread the word: birds aren't real.</p>

Bumper stickers appear on cars nationwide. Some media outlets report on the movement as if it's a genuine conspiracy theory — which is kind of the point.</p>

              <p>Hundreds of supporters rally outside Twitter's San Francisco headquarters, demanding they change their bird logo. The movement reaches peak visibility. In December 2021, McIndoe breaks character on the front page of the New York Times, revealing Birds Aren't Real as satirical performance art designed to hold a mirror up to misinformation culture.</p>

              <p>McIndoe appears on CBS 60 Minutes explaining how Birds Aren't Real fights "lunacy with lunacy." He speaks at SXSW. The movement surpasses 500,000 followers. Academics begin studying it as a case study in post-ironic activism and media literacy. The line between satire and reality has never been blurrier.</p>

              <p>Peter McIndoe gives a TED Talk about using absurdist humor to fight misinformation. The movement becomes a legitimate case study in media literacy courses at universities.

              <p>Birds Aren't Real works because it uses the exact language, aesthetics, and passion of real conspiracy movements — but about something obviously absurd. It teaches media literacy through participation. If you can recognize why "birds are drones" is ridiculous, you can start questioning why you believe other things without evidence. The conspiracy isn't about birds. It's about how easy it is to believe anything if it's presented with enough conviction.</p>
